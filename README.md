# casio-wv-57h-2556-universal-20mm-band-adapter
Attach any 20mm watch band to your Casio WV-57H instead of the one that breaks easily.

You re-use the small spring bar by attaching it first through the large cut-out.

Then attach your watch band using a 20mm spring bar.

If you want to remove the band or adapter, push a pin through either holes.
